Accelerometer: Any kind of linear acceleration, including the orientation of the device because of the acceleration due to gravity from Earth. Can determine rotation to some point due to the sensor itself often isn't in the center of rotation, causing acceleration by centripetal forces. Doesn't work when in the center of rotation, cannot distinguish rotation from acceleration.

Gyroscope: any rotation, unaffected by acceleration.

Magnetometer: orientation and direction by determining the direction of Earth's magnetic field. Can be interfered by the environment, doesn't work everywhere on Earth, potentially useless in a couple of decades due to pole switching.
